# mySocialNetwork

A full-stack social networking platform designed to let users connect, share, and interact in a dynamic online community.  
The project includes both a backend for managing authentication, data storage, and business logic, and a frontend that delivers a clean and interactive user experience.  

With this application, users can create personal accounts, customize their profiles, publish posts, comment on othersâ€™ content, and build relationships by following other users.  
The goal of **mySocialNetwork** is to provide a foundational social media experience similar to popular platforms, while being lightweight and adaptable for learning purposes or future feature expansion.  

This project can be used as a starting point to understand how modern social networks work under the hood, integrating essential functionalities like user management, feeds, and secure communication between client and server.
